Each directory represents a distinct lab assignment, project, or demo application focused on either core C#, data handling, services, or validation logic.

### Directory and Program Descriptions

#### 1. CRUD -2
Contains examples related to **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** operations, demonstrating database connectivity and record management using C#.

#### 2. CalculatorService & CalculatorWebServiceDemo
Showcases how to implement:
- A basic calculator as a C# service.
- A web service demo for calculator functions, introducing concepts of service-oriented programming and remote method invocation.

#### 3. Colinder
Likely an application or example demonstrating a specific algorithm (potentially related to calendar or date operations).

#### 4. Connected
Samples of **connected architecture** such as using ADO.NET for direct database management and manipulation.

#### 5. ConsumerProject
A project demonstrating how a service or application consumes APIs or services, introducing fundamental client-server communication.

#### 6. ItemManagement
Practical code to handle lists of items—add, update, delete, and view item details, foundational for inventory or item tracking applications.

#### 7. MyWebServiceProject
Complete demo of building and hosting a custom web service using C#.

#### 8. Ticket_Number_Validation
Utility to **validate ticket numbers** according to specified rules, demonstrating data validation techniques.

#### 9. VowelCounter
Basic string processing application that counts vowels in input, useful for introducing text manipulation in C#.

#### 10. WebServiceDemo
Another example devoted to web services (SOAP or REST) using C#.

#### 11. WordSorterApp
An application for sorting words within a string or collection, suitable for introductory exercises in data manipulation.

#### 12. flame_game
Likely a mini-game built in C#, illustrating event handling, game loop construction, and simple animation or logic.

#### 13. insertSQl
Shows how to insert data using SQL from a C# application, reinforcing the use of SQL commands and ADO.NET objects.

#### 14. login & login_project
Projects focused on user authentication process, implementing a login form or logic, and handling credential management.

#### 15. validation
Contains form or input validation examples—ensuring correct user data before storage or processing.

#### 16. C-Sharp (file)
May contain notes, source code snippets, or consolidated explanations for C# concepts.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/spideyashith/C-_Lab_Programs.git
   ```
2. **Open the desired folder/project** in your favorite C# IDE (like Visual Studio or Rider).
3. **Build the Project:** Restore dependencies if required and build the project or open individual `.cs` files for study.
4. **Run Individual Programs:** Each project is usually self-contained and can be run for demonstration or testing purposes.
